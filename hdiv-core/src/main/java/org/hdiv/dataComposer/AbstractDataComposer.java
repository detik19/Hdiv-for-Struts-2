/**
 * <p>
 * It processes the data contributed by the HDIV custom tags. The aim of this class
 * is to create an object of type IState for each possible request (form or link) in
 * every page processed by the HDIV custom tags. The IState object is used to
 * validate client's later requests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The process of creating an IState object is as follows: Each time a link or a form
 * processing begins, HDIV custom tags set the request beginning by calling
 * beginRequest method. Once the beginning is set, an IState object is created and it
 * is fill in with all the data of the request(parameter values, non editable
 * values, parameter types) using the compose method. After processing all the request
 * data of the link or form, custom tags set the end of the processing by calling
 * endRequest method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Depending on the strategy defined in HDIV configuration (memory, encoded or hash),
 * the IState object is stored in the user session or is sent to the client in the
 * html code by adding an extra parameter called _HDIV_STATE_.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the memory strategy IState objects are stored in the user session (HttpSession)
 * while in the encoded and hash strategies these objects are stored in the client.
 * </p>
